# What is this?
This is our 2nd game in pygame, this game don't have name for now if you have some idea you can tell it us. 

This game will be some kind of 2d survival where you need to collect resources and spend them on buildings or other stuff to survive.

We are streaming our "game development" on twitch on [this channel](https://www.twitch.tv/escanor______).

You can download it and try to test this out if you have some questions or feedback we will answer :D.
